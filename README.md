# cars_list

  This application was created to give opportunity for selling and buying vehicles. You can visit it and look for a vehicle or add your one for selling. Registered users are allowed to make inquiries for different cars. Each user can make only one inquiry for each car and he/she has own inquiries list at dashboard. What is more, application has search form which helps users to find vehicle faster and it has also filters to divide cars by different characteristics.   
  
  This application was created with Python 3.7.4 and Django 3.0.3 . As a database I used PostgreSQL. For handling images I used Pillow. Project will be deployed to Digital Ocean some time soon.
